# UX/UI documentation

## Introduction
The main goal of the UX/UI team was to understand the user and try to define their needs and frustrations, as well as their motivation to use our Dots. web app. We did this, for example, by organising a brainstorming session with the Kona B team, conducting research on the experience of refugees, creating user personas, user journies and wireframes, and interviewing different kinds of people that had connections to Senegal (e.g. we spoke to a Senegalese citizen based in Geneva, Abdou, and a refugee living in Senegal, Loua). The real life experiences in particular, provided us with valuable insights into Senegal's socio-economic landscape, and brought us closer to the type of user that might interact with Dots. These exercises formed the basis for our final design decisions (i.e. features, colour palette, etc.). The images included in this file (brainstorming, user personas, etc.) can be accessed and viewed in more detail on the following Figma design page:

## Brainstorming
One of the first team exercises we did was a brainstorming session on the user needs, motivations, and frustrations - not only was it a useful way to understand and define the types of users that might interact with our web app, it was also a great team building activity. Our Figma jam "inspiration" board was the main tool for this.

## User research
A significant challenge for the UX team was to know and understand the different types of users that would be interacting with Dots. A typical UX sprint involves conducting user interviews. However, this was not possible, at least in the beginning of the project. One of the ways we tried to overcome this knowledge gap was by researching the experience of refugees and migrants and, in particular, how they might use technology to access support services. The following research paper https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR4322.html discusses the role that technology plays in the lives of displaced people and included interviews with 6 different focus groups of refugees. It offered some interesting insights into how people in vulnerable situations interact with technology (e.g. privacy/data concerns, connectivity issues). We also did some research on mobile apps with similar objectives/mission to Dots. (e.g. RefAid, I-Need Switzerland). 
## User personas & user journey
Initially we created a user persona (based on our research and brainstorming) using a fictional character "Khady", a domestic abuse survivor. We mapped out a user journey for Khady, which was a useful exercise in the sense that it brought up some questions regarding how a vulnerable person like Khady might perceive the app and the importance of having reassuring messaging and/or visual imagery to build trust and make her feel secure when using it. Later on we were fortunate to interview Loua, a refugee living in Senegal, who was able to give us his lived experience as a vulnerable person trying to access basic services for himself and for his family.

## Sketches
Before building the wireframes and mockups, we decided to do some basic sketches of what we thought the web app could look like, in particular, the homepage, the quiz, and the table of organisations. It was a helpful way to visualise key features and functionalities of the web app (e.g. for the quiz, having a progress bar and a back button).

## Wireframes & Mockups
The primary tool we used for this part of the design phase was Figma. Our wireframes and mockups can be viewed at the below link.

## App colour palette selection
In the end we decided to use a colour palette similar to Kona Connect as Dots. will be operated by them. We also chose softer colours than what we had originally conceived.

## Tools & Resources
Using Figma, we created an "inspiration" board to share ideas, brainstorm, and document some of our designs.
