    "Kona Connect, in partnership with women++ and a team of expert volunteers from around the world, have developed a tool to connect people in need to the organisations best equipped to help them. This tool – an alternative legal aid web app called Dots. – was built as part of a 6-week software development programme for social good 'deploy(impact)', and is being piloted in Senegal.",
    "Dots., accessible through any desktop and smartphone device, includes a search assistant option that will guide users to the right organisations whilst simultaneously reducing aid organisations' workloads, freeing up time to help more individuals in need."
